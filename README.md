The database project for Mr. John's online electronics marketplace is designed using MySQL to manage and streamline operations within his digital platform. 
The database schema includes key entities such as `Customer`, `Order`, `Product`, and `Vendor`, each with specific attributes to track essential information. 
The `Customer` table captures details about users and their categories and discounts, while the `Order` table records transactions, payment methods, and invoice details. 
The `Product` table maintains information on product availability, pricing, and quantity, and the `Vendor` table keeps track of supplier details. 
This structured approach ensures efficient management of data, supports seamless transactions, and enhances the overall user experience in the online marketplace.
